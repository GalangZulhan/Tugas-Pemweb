    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

    <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

        The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.

        In some situations, the COVID-19 virus can spread by a person being exposed to small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission. It's not yet known how common it is for the virus to spread this way.

        It can also spread if a person touches a surface or object with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, but the risk is low.

        Some reinfections of the virus that causes COVID-19 have happened, but these have been uncommon.
      </p>
      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>Risk factors for COVID-19 appear to include:
        <ul>
          <li>Close contact (within 6 feet, or 2 meters) with someone who has COVID-19</li>
          <li>Being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>
        Although most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. Older adults or people with existing medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.

        Complications can include:
        <ul>
          <li>Pneumonia and trouble breathing</li>
          <li>Organ failure in several organs</li>
          <li>Heart problems</li>
          <li>A severe lung condition that causes a low amount of oxygen to go through your bloodstream to your organs (acute respiratory distress syndrome)</li>
          <li>Blood clots</li>
          <li>Acute kidney injury</li>
          <li>Additional viral and bacterial infections</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency use authorization to some COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. A vaccine can prevent you from getting the COVID-19 virus or prevent you from becoming seriously ill if you get the COVID-19 virus. Also, if you are fully vaccinated, you can return to many activities you may not have been able to do because of the pandemic — including not wearing a mask or social distancing — except where required by a rule or law. If you are fully vaccinated and have a condition or are taking medications that weaken your immune system, you may need to keep wearing a mask.

        If you haven’t had the COVID-19 vaccine, you can take many steps to reduce your risk of infection. WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19: 
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.
          </li>
          <li>Keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). This is especially important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Keep in mind some people may have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have COVID-19.</li>
          <li>Avoid crowds and indoor places that have poor ventilation.</li>
          <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
          <li>Wear a face mask in indoor public spaces and outdoors where there is a high risk of COVID-19 transmission, such as at a crowded event or large gathering. Further mask guidance differs depending on whether you are fully vaccinated or unvaccinated. Surgical masks may be used if available. N95 respirators should be reserved for health care providers.</li>
          <li>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue. Wash your hands right away.</li>
          <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
          <li>Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, towels, bedding and other household items if you're sick.</li>
          <li>Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters, daily.</li>
          <li>Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if you're sick.</li>
        </ul>
        If you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your doctor about other ways to protect yourself.
      </p>
      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>If you're planning to travel, first check the CDC and WHO websites for updates and advice. Be prepared to wear a mask and use appropriate hand hygiene when in public. You may also want to talk with your doctor if you have health conditions that make you more susceptible to respiratory infections and complications.</p>
